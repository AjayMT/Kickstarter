                So you need to start working. Maybe you're a web developer. You launch a browser, launch your terminal emulator, and launch an editor. And when you need to start working again, you do this all over again. And it gets tedious.
             </div>
             <div>
                 <h1 id="solution"><a href="#solution">The Solution</a></h1>
                 This is an extremely repetitive process, which means it can be automated, and that's what Kickstarter does. Launch apps once, capture a 'setup' with Kickstarter, and launch that setup whenever you need to start working. You can even run shell commands with the shell of your choice.
